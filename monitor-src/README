TODO: Dan and Alex brain dump here


Setup:
	## Package set up

	# this is for airmon and to set wifi into monitor adapter
	sudo apt install aircrack-ng

	# for packet sniffing
	sudo apt install python3-scapy

	# set up time sync
	sudo apt install ntp

	sudo systemctl restart ntp

	sudo systemctl status ntp
		#See that its working
	reboot

	# prepare reboot sequence
	copy prepare-wlan1.service to /etc/systemd/system/prepare-wlan1.service

	sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	sudo systemctl enable prepare-wlan1.service
	sudo systemctl start prepare-wlan1.service

	# set up is now done for packages (yay!)

	## Scripts set up
	# Who needs modularity! We have some directly hard coded things so some things might need to happen

	1. use iw list to insure that wifi adapter has monitor mode.
	2. use iwconfig to isure that names a line with our code. If wlan0 and wlan1 doesn't align please change
	3. change pathing in start.sh and prepare-wlan1.service to align with system set up.
